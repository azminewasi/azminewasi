## [**About**](https://azminewasi.github.io/index.html) :
- An aspiring AI researcher and engineering student, exploring **Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) in Bio-Medical AI**, mainly focusing on **neuro, biomedical and bio-/molecular** domains. Along with GNN, my other research interests include **Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Human-Centered AI** for interdisciplinary works.
- **I am looking forward to pursue a PhD in Fall 2025 to continue research** and looking for potential options.
- I am working on [Data Intelligence Lab, HYU, KR](https://dilab.hanyang.ac.kr/). I have founded [Computational Intelligence and Operations Lab - CIOL, SUST, BD](https://ciol-sust.github.io/), to mentor young researchers and bridge the gap between Industrial Engineering and AI. I'm also the **3rd [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/azminetoushikwasi/) Grandmaster** of BD.
- My works has been published in prestigious venues such as **LREC-COLING'24, ICLR'24** Tiny Papers Track, Workshops of **NeurIPS'23, AAAI'24, ICML'24, ACL'24 and CHI'24**, with ongoing reviews in **ACCV'24, TCBB, EMNLP'24, CIKM'24, UIST'24, CSCW'24**, among others.
- Outside research, I have work experience in **AI-integrated IT Automation, Project - Product Management and Analytics** roles.
- Passionate about **learning new things, sharing my knowledge, improving myself regularly, experimenting with acquired skills and challenging my capabilities**. Building all-in-one free AI/ML resources collection [here](https://github.com/azminewasi/online-ml-university).
- Serving as reviewer in top ML conferences, workshops and journals like ACL ARR, ICLR, IDC, ICML, MICCAI regularly; and program chair in multiple ACL'24 workshops.
- Actively looking for research opportunities in theoretical or applied GNNs in medical domains (molecular/biomedical/neuroscience).

## [**Research**](https://azminewasi.github.io/) :
- ‚öôÔ∏è Machine Learning:
    I am working on theoretical and applied machine learning, specially probabilistic modeling and inference, generative models, GFlowNets and its applications, etc.
    I've published in ICLR'24 and COLING'24, and workshops of AAAI'24, NeurIPS'23, ACL'24, ICML'24 and CHI'24. I regularly serve as reviewer for top ML conferences (ACL-RR, ICLR) and workshops (ICML, ACL, MICCAI).

- üí† **Graph Neural Networks (GNN)**: 
    I am exploring Graph Neural Network or Geometric Machine Learning Theories, applying and improving GNN models and resources in Healthcare (Drugs, Proteins and Molecules) [DDI](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17210),
    Knowledge Graphs [BanglaAutoKG](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03528) (COLING'24), and Supply Chains [SupplyGraph](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.15299) (AAAI'24W).

- üß¨ **Medical AI**: 
    In Medical AI, I am working on developing AI systems for Healthcare, mainly focusing on Computational Molecular Biology - Neuroscience, Bioinformatics, Computational Drug Discovery [CADGL](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17210), 
    and Healthcare Optimization [Glucose level control](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13852) (ICLR'24).

- üßë‚Äçüíª **Human-Centered AI (HAI)**: 
    Despite extensive coursework in ergonomics, Human Factors Engineering (HFE), behavior studies, and psychology within our IPE curriculum, there's a notable gap in inter-disciplinary research between IPE and AI in BD.
    Motivated by this, I am working on integrating HFE [AI Ownership](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00027), [Individuality](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00026) (CHI'24W),
    [Ergonomics in [LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02885)/UIs (UIST'24 In Review, ICML'24-W)],
    Computational Social Science (CSS) [Social Biases](https://heal-workshop.github.io/#:~:text=Exploring%20Bengali%20Religious%20Dialect%20Biases) (CHI'24W),
    Fairness and Reliability [ARBEx](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.13402) into AI systems, focusing on HAI perspectives of IPE.

- üìù **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**: 
    In Natural Language Processing, I am developing [Knowledge Graphs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03528) (COLING'24) and Bangla Knowledge Systems; motivated by NLP + GNNs. 
    I am also working on inter-disciplinary CSS, Climate, and BioMedNLP [Molecules+NLP](https://openreview.net/forum?id=VUYCyH8fCw&) (ICLR'24).
