## **About** :
- Experienced in **Programming, Machine Learning, Artificial Intelligence, Inter-disciplinary Research, IT Automation, Project - Product Management and Analytics.**
- Actively involved in several [***Machine Learning Research***](https://azminewasi.github.io/research/index.html). My research interests include **Graph Neural Networks, Human-Centered AI, and Natural Language Processing**, mainly focusing on medical problems. I am working on [Data Intelligence Lab, HYU, KR](https://dilab.hanyang.ac.kr/). Additionally, I have founded [Computational Intelligence and Operations Lab - CIOL, SUST, BD](https://ciol-sust.github.io/), to mentor young researchers and bridge the gap between Industrial Engineering and AI. I'm also the **3rd [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/azminetoushikwasi/) Grandmaster** of BD.
- My research has been published in prestigious venues such as **LREC-COLING'24, ICLR'24 Tiny Papers Track, Workshops of CHI'24, AAAI'24 and NeurIPS'23**, with ongoing reviews in **ECCV'24, IEEE TCBB, ACL ARR**, among others.
- Passionate about **learning new things, sharing my knowledge, improving myself regularly, experimenting with acquired skills and challenging my capabilities**. Building all-in-one free AI/ML resources collection [here](https://github.com/azminewasi/online-ml-university).
- Serving as reviewer in top ML conferences and journals like ACL ARR, ICLR, IDC; and program chair in multiple ACL'24 workshops.
- Actively looking for research opportunities focusing on different Types of GNN Learning and NLP (Theoretical or Applied) or Healthcare (Drugs, Bioinformatics, Biomedical Engineering or Neuroscience and AI) domains with conjunction to any of my research interests.
