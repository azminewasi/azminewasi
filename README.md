## [**About**](https://azminewasi.github.io/index.html) :
- An aspiring AI researcher and engineering student, exploring **Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) in Bio-Medical AI**, mainly focusing on **neuro, therapeutic, and molecular ML** domains (AI4Science). Along with GNN, my other research interests include **AI for Science, Human-Centered AI (HCI, HAI) with NLP** for interdisciplinary works.
- **I am looking forward to pursue a PhD in Fall 2025 to continue research** and looking for potential options.
- Currently, I'm working with [Riashat Islam](https://riashat.github.io/) at Mila Quebec on computational structural biology, molecular ML, and generative AI. Previously, I worked with [Prof. Dong-Kyu Chae](http://dilab.hanyang.ac.kr/) at Hanyang University for 2 years on GNNs, Medical AI, and HCI-HAI. Additionally, I founded [CIOL](https://ciol-sust.github.io/) to mentor young researchers and bridge the gap between Industrial Engineering and AI. Here, I collaborate with [Prof. Mahathir M Bappy](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mahathir-mohammad-bappy-b122a978) (Louisiana State Uni.) and [Prof. Manjurul Ahsan](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=fvWTiS8AAAAJ&hl=en) (Uni. of Oklahoma) on GNNs, Digital Twins, AI4Science, PINNs, and Medical AI applications; and guide young researchers. I'm also the **3rd [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/azminetoushikwasi/) Grandmaster** of BD.
- My works has been published in prestigious venues such as **LREC-COLING'24, CSCW'24, ICLR'24, ACCV'24**, Workshops of **NeurIPS'23, AAAI'24, ICML'24, ACL'24 and CHI'24**, with ongoing reviews in **ACCV'24, TCBB, EMNLP'24**, among others.
- Outside research, I have work experience in **AI-integrated IT Automation, Project - Product Management and Analytics** roles.
- Passionate about **learning new things, sharing my knowledge, improving myself regularly, experimenting with acquired skills and challenging my capabilities**. Building all-in-one free AI/ML resources collection [here](https://github.com/azminewasi/online-ml-university).

## [**Research**](https://azminewasi.github.io/) :
  
- üß¨ **Exploring Computational Biology and Biomedical AI Applications**
  - Working on Computational Molecular Biology, Bioinformatics, and Computational Drug Discovery ([CADGL](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17210)). Exploring problems like molecular properties prediction, protein discovery, binder design and affinity, molecular interactions, structural biology, digital twins design and development, and healthcare optimization ([ICLR'24](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13852)).
  - Worked with de novo protein generation models and experienced with RL-inspired/energy-guided geometric/sequential structural biology modeling tools with GNNs, Flow Matching, GFLowNets and Diffusion models. Working with [Prof. Chae](http://dilab.hanyang.ac.kr/) (HYU), [Dr. Islam](https://riashat.github.io/) (Mila Quebec), Prof. Xu (CMU) and [Prof. Ahsan](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=fvWTiS8AAAAJ&hl=en) (OU) on this area.

- üí† **Understanding and Applying Graph Neural Networks (GNN)**
  - Engaged in Geometric Machine Learning, focusing on GNN theories and applications, with an emphasis on biomedical AI applications as described above. Additionally, applying GNNs to industrial engineering, specifically in supply chain optimization ([GNNs in SCM](https://drive.google.com/file/d/11Lu60WBl5cOlDA0ZcYYSWnkp4v93UkN3/view?usp=sharing)) and manufacturing.
  - Interested in the application of knowledge graphs (extending GNNs) across diverse systems and domains ([COLING'24](https://aclanthology.org/2024.lrec-main.189/), [ACL'24W](https://aclanthology.org/2024.kallm-1.6/), [EMNLP'24W](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.04916)). Working with [Prof. Chae](http://dilab.hanyang.ac.kr/) (HYU), [Dr. Islam](https://riashat.github.io/) (Mila Quebec), Prof. Xu (CMU), [Prof. Bappy](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mahathir-mohammad-bappy-b122a978) (LSU), and [CIOL](https://ciol-researchlab.github.io/) researchers.

- üßë‚Äçüíª **Interdisciplinary Research on Humans, AI, and Language**
  - Despite extensive coursework in ergonomics, human factors, behavior, and psychology within our IPE curriculum, there's a notable gap in inter-disciplinary research between IPE and AI in Bangladesh, which drives my current initiatives in HCI. Focusing on fairness and reliability (AI for Good), I've worked on evaluating and improving human factors and ergonomics ([ICML'24W and EMNLP'24W](https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02885)), religious/cultural values ([CSCW'24](https://drive.google.com/file/u/7/d/10TYbrPmd54D4bONz86HaY8vP4Jjcs3iQ/view?usp=drive_link), [CHI'24W](https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18376), COLING'25 - [1](https://drive.google.com/file/d/11L-jtfG2ORWfDLitC8rheU1dmmEsz89j/view?usp=drive_link), [2](https://drive.google.com/file/d/11Y_jr4tbkGo_f6isUx3-O8NMpoK4OEHi/view?usp=drive_link)) into AI systems, mainly Generative AI and Large Language Models ([ICLR'25](https://openreview.net/forum?id=k3gCieTXeY)).
  - Working with Cohere for AI Community, [Prof. Chae](http://dilab.hanyang.ac.kr/) (HYU), and [CIOL](https://ciol-researchlab.github.io/) researchers on this area.
