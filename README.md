## [**About**](https://azminewasi.github.io/index.html) :
- An aspiring AI researcher and engineering student, exploring **Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) in Bio-Medical AI**, mainly focusing on **neuro, therapeutic, and molecular ML** domains (AI4Science). Along with GNN, my other research interests include **AI for Science, Human-Centered AI (HCI, HAI) with NLP** for interdisciplinary works.
- **I am looking forward to pursue a PhD in Spring/Fall 2026 to continue research** and looking for potential options.
- Currently, I'm working with [Riashat Islam](https://riashat.github.io/) at Mila Quebec on computational structural biology, molecular ML, and generative AI. Previously, I worked with [Prof. Dong-Kyu Chae](http://dilab.hanyang.ac.kr/) at Hanyang University for 2 years on GNNs, Medical AI, and HCI-HAI. Additionally, I founded [CIOL](https://ciol-sust.github.io/) to mentor young researchers and bridge the gap between Industrial Engineering and AI. Here, I collaborate with [Prof. Mahathir M Bappy](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mahathir-mohammad-bappy-b122a978) (Louisiana State Uni.) and [Prof. Manjurul Ahsan](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=fvWTiS8AAAAJ&hl=en) (Uni. of Oklahoma) on GNNs, Digital Twins, AI4Science, PINNs, and Medical AI applications; and guide young researchers. I'm also the **3rd [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/azminetoushikwasi/) Grandmaster** of BD.
- My works has been published in prestigious venues such as **ICLR, WWW, COLING, DASFAA, CSCW, ACCV'24**, Workshops of **NeurIPS, AAAI, ICML, ACL and CHI**, with ongoing reviews in some others.
- Outside research, I have work experience in **AI-integrated IT Automation, Project - Product Management and Analytics** roles.
- Passionate about **learning new things, sharing my knowledge, improving myself regularly, experimenting with acquired skills and challenging my capabilities**. Building all-in-one free AI/ML resources collection [here](https://github.com/azminewasi/online-ml-university).
