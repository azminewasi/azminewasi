## [**About**](https://azminewasi.github.io/index.html) :
- An aspiring AI researcher and engineering student, exploring **AI4Science, Biomedical AI, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), AI Agents and Reasoning**, with an emphasis on **structural biology, therapeutic, clinical, and molecular ML** domains. Along with GNN, my other research interests include **interdisciplinary** research in **AI agents** and Human-Centered AI (HCI, HAI) with NLP (Multilinguality, Bias and Fairness).
- **I am looking forward to pursue a PhD in Spring/Fall 2026 to continue research** and looking for potential options.
- I collaborate with [Prof. Alshehri (KSU)](https://www.ai4chemia.org/about) on Generative AI, health informatics, GNNs, and AI agents; and [Prof. Chae (HYU)](http://dilab.hanyang.ac.kr/) on GenAI, LLM-HCI, and Biomolecular ML with GNNs.  
- I also work with [Riashat Islam](https://riashat.github.io/) (Microsoft Research) on molecular ML, GenAI, agents, and reasoning; and with Prof. Min Xu (CMU) on biomolecules.  I actively collaborate with researchers from Cohere Labs (formerly Cohere for AI), Harvard, and more.  Completed [HTGAA 2025 (MIT)](https://azminewasi.notion.site/HTGAA-Azmine-Toushik-Wasi-1954d7794a988030930fdc70b988f33e), focusing on protein engineering.  
- At [CIOL](https://ciol-researchlab.github.io/), I collaborate with  [Prof. AMM Mukaddes (SUST)](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=HOOJPRYAAAAJ&hl=en),  [Prof. Ahsan (OU)](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=fvWTiS8AAAAJ&hl=en), and  [Prof. Bappy (LSU)](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mahathir-mohammad-bappy-b122a978) on GNNs, agents, and digital twins for industrial and medical applications.
- My works has been published in prestigious venues such as **ICLR, WWW, COLING, DASFAA, ACCV, CSCW**, Workshops of **NeurIPS, AAAI, ICML, ACL and CHI**, with ongoing reviews in some others.
- Outside research, I have work experience in **AI-integrated IT Automation, Project - Product Management and Analytics** roles. I'm also the **3rd [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/azminetoushikwasi/) Grandmaster** of BD.
- Passionate about **learning new things, sharing my knowledge, improving myself regularly, experimenting with acquired skills and challenging my capabilities**. Building all-in-one free AI/ML resources collection [here](https://github.com/azminewasi/online-ml-university).

## [**Research**](https://azminewasi.github.io/) :

- üß¨ **Exploring Computational Biology and Biomedical AI Applications**: Working on Computational Molecular Biology, Bioinformatics, and Drug Discovery, focusing on molecular property prediction, protein discovery, and binder design. Experienced in de novo protein generation, RL/energy-guided modeling with GNNs, Flow Matching, GFlowNets, and Diffusion models. Exploring Digital Twins, clinical reasoning and Agentic LLMs for clinical/biomedical applications.
- üí† **Understanding and Applying Graph Neural Networks (GNN)**:  Engaged in Geometric Machine Learning, focusing on GNN theories and applications, with an emphasis on biomedical AI applications as described above.
    Additionally, applying GNNs to industrial engineering, specifically in supply chain optimization and manufacturing.
    Interested in the application of knowledge graphs (extending GNNs) across diverse systems and domains.
- üßë‚Äçüíª **Interdisciplinary Research on Humans, AI, and Language**: Working on RL and reasoning in LLMs, focusing on self-verification, uncertainty estimation, and agentic decision-making in generative models, with AI4Good applications. My recent work develops trustworthy AI reasoning by integrating RAG, reward-based RL fine-tuning, Digital Twins, and structured reasoning to enhance model reliability. Additionally, in AI for Good, Worked on multilinguality, accessibility, fairness, human factors, and cultural values in Generative AI and LLMs.
