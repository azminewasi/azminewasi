## [**About**](https://azminewasi.github.io/index.html) :
- An aspiring AI researcher and engineering student, exploring **Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) in Bio-Medical AI**, mainly focusing on **neuro, therapeutic, and molecular ML** domains (AI4Science). Along with GNN, my other research interests include **AI for Science, Human-Centered AI (HCI, HAI) with NLP** for interdisciplinary works.
- **I am looking forward to pursue a PhD in Spring/Fall 2026 to continue research** and looking for potential options.
- Currently, I'm working with [Riashat Islam](https://riashat.github.io/) at Mila Quebec on Agentic AI and Generative AI, and computational biology - molecular ML. Previously, I worked with [Prof. Dong-Kyu Chae](http://dilab.hanyang.ac.kr/) at Hanyang University for 2 years on GNNs, Medical AI, and HCI-HAI. Additionally, I founded [CIOL](https://ciol-sust.github.io/) to mentor young researchers and bridge the gap between Industrial Engineering and AI. Here, I collaborate with [Prof. Mahathir M Bappy](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mahathir-mohammad-bappy-b122a978) (Louisiana State Uni.) and [Prof. Manjurul Ahsan](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=fvWTiS8AAAAJ&hl=en) (Uni. of Oklahoma) on GNNs, Digital Twins, AI4Science, PINNs, and Medical AI applications; and guide young researchers. I am also a Contributor in Cohere for AI Aommunity and regularly work on Cohere projects. I work as Research Scientist at HerWILL, too. I'm also the **3rd [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/azminetoushikwasi/) Grandmaster** of BD.
- My works has been published in prestigious venues such as **ICLR, WWW, COLING, DASFAA, CSCW, ACCV'24**, Workshops of **NeurIPS, AAAI, ICML, ACL and CHI**, with ongoing reviews in some others.
- Outside research, I have work experience in **AI-integrated IT Automation, Project - Product Management and Analytics** roles.
- Passionate about **learning new things, sharing my knowledge, improving myself regularly, experimenting with acquired skills and challenging my capabilities**. Building all-in-one free AI/ML resources collection [here](https://github.com/azminewasi/online-ml-university).

## [**Research**](https://azminewasi.github.io/) :

- üß¨ **Exploring Computational Biology and Biomedical AI Applications**: Working on Computational Molecular Biology,
Bioinformatics, and Drug Discovery, focusing on molecular property prediction, protein discovery, and binder design.
Experienced in de novo protein generation, RL/energy-guided modeling with GNNs, Flow Matching, GFlowNets, and
Diffusion models. Exploring Digital Twins, clinical reasoning and Agentic LLMs for clinical/biomedical applications
- üí† **Understanding and Applying Graph Neural Networks (GNN)**:  Engaged in Geometric Machine Learning, focusing on GNN
theories and applications, with an emphasis on biomedical AI applications as described above. Additionally, applying GNNs
to industrial engineering, specifically in supply chain optimization and manufacturing. Interested in the application of
knowledge graphs (extending GNNs) across diverse systems and domains.
- üßë‚Äçüíª **Interdisciplinary Research on Humans, AI, and Language**: I‚Äôm working on RL and reasoning in LLMs, focusing on
self-verification, uncertainty estimation, and agentic decision-making in generative models, with AI4Good applications. My
recent work develops trustworthy AI reasoning by integrating RAG, reward-based RL fine-tuning, Digital Twins, and
structured reasoning to enhance model reliability. Additionally, in AI for Good, I‚Äôve worked on multilinguality, accessibility,
fairness, human factors, and cultural values in Generative AI and LLMs.
